### CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 3
Lab 3, Part-1 was one of my favorite labs starting out because it started as challenge but as time went on I learned more about output and input. This was a lab where we were directed to create a math formula to determine the unit price of a pizza in its diameters in inches. I liked this because it was a simple solution, using input from the user and adding it into our formula running the code to output the unit price. I struggled at first and did not know what I was doing and expected more from the first challenging lab.

* Lab 7
Lab 7, Part-1 was one of my favorite labs because it felt like I was working with something for the city, where we created code to be able to tell the input if parking was either allowed or not allowed. During this lab I learned more due to my parter, my partner also explained most of the confusion that I had. Here I learned how to create arguments and wether there was enough or not enough arguments. I enjoyed messing around with if statements, if something was wrong it would print one thing out and if it was right it would print the correct expectation. I learned I really like working with if, else if, and else statements more than anything.

* Lab 9
Lab 9, Part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was where was having the most trouble I was working by myself and I was ripping my hair out until I re-read what the instructions were about. I also worked with if statements and out put to the terminal along with cout to respond to the user. What I liked about majority of the labs not just this one was about outputting the answer that was expected on the other end of the input (the user).
