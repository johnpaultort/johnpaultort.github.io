### CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 3
Lab 3, Part-1 was one of my favorite labs starting out because it started as challenge but as time went on I learned more about output and input. This was a lab where we were directed to create a math formula to determine the unit price of a pizza in its diameters in inches. I liked this because it was a simple solution, using input from the user and adding it into our formula running the code to output the unit price. I struggled at first and did not know what I was doing and expected more from the first challenging lab.

* Lab 12
Lab 12, Part-1 was one of my favorite labs although it was recent, but at the time I was struggling to undertstand some of the labs due to demotivation. My partner was someone that communicated and allowed me to focus on what we were going to be doing in the lab. I learned a little but more from the conversion of the file and changing it into a gif. We finished this lab during class, it was very challenging but at the same time easy to understand.s

* Lab 7
Lab 7, Part-1 was one of my favorite labs because it felt like I was working with something for the city, where we created code to be able to tell the input if parking was either allowed or not allowed. During this lab I learned more due to my parter, my partner also explained most of the confusion that I had. Here I learned how to create arguments and wether there was enough or not enough arguments. I enjoyed messing around with if statements, if something was wrong it would print one thing out and if it was right it would print the correct expectation.
